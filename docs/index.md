# Overview

## Interactive Data Visualization with R Shiny for Life Sciences

This repository houses the slides and training materials for a two-day R Shiny tutorial, conducted for the Zurich Ph.D. Program in Molecular Life Sciences (joint program of the University of Zurich and ETH Zurich) in April 2024. The content covers basic to advanced topics and is ideal for anyone looking to improve their data visualisation skills with R Shiny.

## Tutorial description

Discover the versatility of R Shiny and explore real-world examples that show how it can be used to efficiently visualise and share scientific data. Learn the basic concepts of R Shiny and create your first R Shiny application from scratch, guided by step-by-step instructions, choosing from several flavours what best suits your needs. Create a dashboard and master interactive elements such as downloading plots, selecting points and zooming into plots. Complete a mini-project with peers to customise your app with advanced widgets, layouts or statistical functions. In addition we will briefly dive into the basics of web development to customise your application beyond the standard options, add a help function and explore methods for sharing and hosting your Shiny apps.

**Course Dates**: April 8 (1-4 pm) & 11 (2-5 pm) 2024  
**Site**: Irchel campus (UZH)  
**Tutors**: Michael Teske & Jonas Schmid, Institute of Experimental Immunology, University of Zurich

1 ECTS point will be awarded upon course completion.
