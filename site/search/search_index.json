Learn the basic concepts of R Shiny and create your first R Shiny application from scratch, guided by step-by-step instructions, choosing from several flavours what best suits your needs. Create a dashboard and master interactive elements such as downloading plots, selecting points and zooming into plots. Complete a mini-project with peers to customise your app with advanced widgets, layouts or statistical functions. In addition we will briefly dive into the basics of web development to customise your application beyond the standard options, add a help function and explore methods for sharing and hosting your Shiny apps.</p> <p>Course Dates: April 8 (1-4 pm) &amp; 11 (2-5 pm) 2024 Site: Irchel campus (UZH) Tutors: Michael Teske &amp; Jonas Schmid, Institute of Experimental Immunology, University of Zurich</p> <p>1 ECTS point will be awarded upon course completion</p>"},{"location":"#course-outline","title":"Course outline","text":"<p>Day 1:</p> <ul> <li>Introduction to R Shiny, first app</li> <li>Quick review of ggplot2</li> <li>Exploring Widgets</li> <li>Creating a dashboard</li> </ul> <p>Day 2:</p> <ul> <li>Implementing interactive plot functions</li> <li>Advanced R Shiny customization</li> <li>Deploying Shiny apps</li> </ul> <p>Assignment:</p> <p>Mini-project, further customisation of the app with advanced elements and functions (completion of milestones, group work possible) - Workload: ca. 20 h</p>"},{"location":"#requirements","title":"Requirements","text":"<ul> <li>Basic R skills<ul> <li>Basic understanding of R syntax</li> <li>Familiarity with installing and loading packages</li> <li>Working with data frames</li> <li>Creating plots (ggplot2)</li> </ul> </li> <li>Laptop with recent version of R Studio and access to UZH/eduroam WiFi</li> <li>Full participation in all sessions</li> <li>Completion of mini-project assignment within 10 days after the tutorial</li> </ul> <p>Further details will be provided to the participants shortly before the course starts, and additional information will be posted in the dedicated Slack channel.</p>"},{"location":"example_app/","title":"Example app","text":"<p>The aim of the course is to create something similar to this example app in your own flavour. </p> <p>The app uses the Iris dataset and provides a violin plot with customisable point sizes via a slider.

It is possible to select an area of the plot, with details of the selected points displayed in a table below. The contents of the table can be downloaded as a csv file, e.g. for further processing in MS Excel. A double-click zooms into the selected area.
